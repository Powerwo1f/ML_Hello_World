ðŸš€ MyFirstMLModel
In this project, I am building my first machine learning model using TensorFlow.
The model is trained on a small dataset to approximate a linear relationship of the form y = 2x - 1.

Used:
  Python 3.11
  TensorFlow
  Numpy
  Virtual environment (venv)

The project includes training the model, testing predictions on new values, and basic practice with the loss function.
